# Setup guide

To run and utilize all functions of _RMut_ package, three following installations should be conducted in sequence:

## Java SE Development Kit

Core algorithms of _RMut_ package were written in Java, thus a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) is required to run the package.
The JDK is available at:

[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

The version of JDK should be greater than or equal to 8.

## RMut package

The _RMut_ package should be properly installed into the R environment by typing the following commands into the R console:

_> install.packages("rJava")_

_> devtools::install\_github("csclab/RMut", args="--no-multiarch")_

Though all of core algorithms written in Java, the _rJava_ package must be firstly installed in the R environment as well. 
Normally, the dependent package would be also installed by the above command. Otherwise, we should install it manually in a similar way to RMut. After installation, the RMut package can be loaded via

_> library(RMut)_

## OpenCL library

In order to utilize the full computing power of multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), OpenCL drivers should be installed into your system. Here are necessary steps for a system with:

* NVIDIA graphics cards
    
    OpenCL support is included in the latest drivers, in the driver CD or available at 
    
    [www.nvidia.com/drivers](www.nvidia.com/drivers).
    
* AMD graphics cards

    The OpenCL GPU runtime library is included in the AMD Catalyst drivers of your AMD cards. We should install the latest version of the Catalyst drivers to take advantage of the AMD GPU's capabilities with OpenCL. The drivers could be in the driver CD or available at
    
    [http://support.amd.com/en-us/download](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download)

* CPU devices only (No graphics cards)
    
     The "AMD APP SDK" tool is provided to the developer community to accelerate the programming in a heterogeneous environment. It contains the OpenCL runtime library for CPU hardware. Install the latest SDK from:
    
    [http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/](http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/) 
    
    
    Figure 1 shows some important setup steps (SDK version v3.0). As shown in the figure, we could install the SDK from Internet connection directly and select _Complete_ setup type.
    
    ![AMD APP SDK installation guide](https://github.com/csclab/RMut/blob/master/vignettes/amd_sdk.png)
    
    
After installation, OpenCL information can be outputed via the function _showOpencl_. Then we can enable OpenCL computation on a CPU/GPU device via the function _setOpencl_:

```{r}
library(RMut)
showOpencl()
setOpencl("gpu")
```

The above functions show installed OpenCL platforms with their corresponding CPU/GPU devices, and try to select an graphics card for OpenCL computing.

# Loading networks

Networks can be loaded in two ways using RMut:

## _loadNetwork_ function

The _loadNetwork_ function creates a network from a Tab-separated values text file. The file format contains three columns: 

- _source_ and _target_: are gene/protein identifiers that are used to define nodes
- _interaction type_: labels the edges connecting each pair of nodes

The function returned a network object which contains:
  
* The network name
* Three data frames used for storing attributes of the nodes/edges and the network itself, respectively

  Here is an example:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(RMut)
amrn <- loadNetwork("/data-raw/networks/AMRN.sif")
print(amrn)
```

  Finally, the loaded network object _amrn_ has five components:
  
* _name_: a string variable represents the network identifier, _AMRN.sif_ in this case.
* _nodes_: a data frame which initially contains one column for node identifiers. 

    In this example network, there exists 10 nodes. Additional columns for other node-based attributes would be inserted later.
    
* _edges_: a data frame which initially contains one column for edge identifiers. 

    In this example, there exists 22 edges. Additional columns for other edge-based attributes would be inserted later.
    
* _network_: a data frame which initially contains one column for the network identifier (_AMRN.sif_ in this case). 

    Additional columns for other network-based attributes would be inserted later, such as total number of feedback/feed-forward loops.
    
* _transitionNetwork_: a Boolean variable denotes whether the network is a transition network or not, in this case the value is _FALSE_.

    The _findAttractors_ function returns a transition network object in which the _transitionNetwork_ variable has a value _TRUE_. For all other cases, the variable has a value _FALSE_.
  
## _data_ function

In addition, the package provides some example networks that could be simply loaded by _data_ command. For ex.,

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)
```

The package supplied four example datasets from small-scale to large-scale real biological networks:

* _amrn_

    The Arabidopsis morphogenesis regulatory network (AMRN) with 10 nodes and 22 links.
* _cdrn_

    The cell differentiation regulatory network (CDRN) with 9 nodes and 15 links.
* _ccsn_

    The canonical cell signaling network (CCSN) with 771 nodes and 1633 links.
* _hsn_

    The large-scale human signaling network (HSN) with 1192 nodes and 3102 links.

# Dynamics analyses

The package utilizes a Boolean network model with synchronous updating scheme, and provides two types of useful analyses of Boolean dynamics in real biological networks or random networks:

## Sensitivity analyses

Via _calSensitivity_ function, this package computes nodal/edgetic sensitivity against many types of mutations in terms of Boolean dynamics. We classified ten well-known mutations into two types (refer to RMut paper for more details): 

* _Node-based_ mutations: state-flip, rule-flip, outcome-shuffle, knockout and overexpression

* _Edgetic_ mutations: edge-removal, edge-attenuation, edge-addition, edge-sign-switch, and edge-reverse

In addition, we note that multiple sets of random Nested Canalyzing rules could be specified, and thus resulted in multiple sensitivity values for each node/edge. Here, we show an example of some sensitivity types:

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# generate all possible initial-states each containing 10 Boolean nodes
set1 <- generateStates(10, "all")

# generate all possible groups each containing a single node in the AMRN network
amrn <- generateGroups(amrn, "all", 1, 0)
amrn <- calSensitivity(amrn, set1, 1, "rule flip", numRuleSets = 2)
print(amrn$Group_1)

# generate all possible groups each containing a single edge in the AMRN network
amrn <- generateGroups(amrn, "all", 0, 1)
amrn <- calSensitivity(amrn, set1, 2, "edge removal")
print(amrn$Group_2)

# generate all possible groups each containing a new edge (not exist in the AMRN network)
amrn <- generateGroups(amrn, "all", 0, 1, TRUE)
amrn <- calSensitivity(amrn, set1, 3, "edge addition")
print(amrn$Group_3)
```

As shown above, we firstly need to generate a set of initial-states by the function _generateStates_. Then by the function _generateGroups_, we continue to generate three sets of node/edge groups whose their sensitivity would be calculated. Finally, the sensitivity values are stored in the same data frame of node/edge groups. The data frame has one column for group identifiers (lists of nodes/edges), and some next columns containing their sensitivity values according to each set of random update-rules. For example, the mutation _rule-flip_ used two sets of Nested Canalyzing rules, thus resulted in two corresponding sets of sensitivity values.

## Attractor cycles identification

Via _findAttractors_ function, the landscape of the network state transitions along with attractor cycles would be identified. The returned transition network object has same structures with the normal network object resulted from _loadNetwork_ function (see section "_loadNetwork_ function"). An example is demonstrated as follows:

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# generate all possible initial-states each containing 10 Boolean nodes
set1 <- generateStates(10, "all")

# generate a set of only conjunction rules
generateRule(amrn)

transNet <- findAttractors(amrn, set1)

# print some first network states
head(transNet$nodes)
# print some first transition links between network states
head(transNet$edges)
output(transNet)
```

As shown in the example, there exists some different points inside two nodes/edges's data frames of the _transNet_ object compared to those of normal network objects:

* _nodes_: 

    The first column is also used for node identifiers, but in this case they represent _states_ of the analyzed network _amrn_. There exists 1024 nodes which are equivalent to 1024 network states of _amrn_. 
    
    Additional columns are described as follows:
    * _Attractor_: value _1_ denotes the network state belongs to an attractor, otherwises _0_.
    * _NetworkState_: specifies the network state of the node.
    
* _edges_: 

    The first column is also used for edge identifiers, but in this case they represent _transition links_ of the analyzed network _amrn_. Each edge identifier has a string _(1)_ which denotes a directed link between two node identifiers. There exists 1024 edges which are equivalent to 1024 transition links of _amrn_. 
    
    Additional columns are described as follows:
    * _Attractor_: value _1_ means that the transition link connects two network states of an attractor, otherwises _0_.
    
We take the node _N6_ as an example. Its corresponding network state is _0000000101_ which represents Boolean values of all nodes in alphabetical order of the analyzed network _amrn_:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)
amrn <- findFBLs(amrn)

for(i in 1:length(amrn$nodes$NodeID)) {
  s <- format(amrn$nodes$NodeID[i], width=8)
  cat(s)
}

cat("\n")
state <- "0000000101"
a <- strsplit(state, split="")
a <- unlist(a)
for(i in 1:length(a)) {
  s <- format(a[i], width=8)
  cat(s)
}
```

Moreover, the _Attractor_ value _1_ means that _N6_ belongs to an attractor. And the data frame _edges_ also shows a transition link _N6 (1) N6_ with _Attractor_ value 1. It means that _N6 (1) N6_ is a fixed point attractor.

Finally, the resulted transition network could be exported by the function _output_ (see section "_Export results_"). Three CSV files were outputed for the transition network itself and nodes/edges attributes with the following names: _AMRN\_trans.sif_, _AMRN\_trans\_out\_nodes.csv_ and _AMRN\_trans\_out\_edges.csv_, respectively. Then, those resulted files could be further loaded and analyzed by other softwares with powerful visualization functions like Cytoscape. For more information on Cytoscape, please refer to [http://www.cytoscape.org/](http://www.cytoscape.org/). In this tutorial, we used Cytoscape version 3.4.0.

The transition network is written as a SIF file (*.__sif__). The SIF file could be loaded to Cytoscape with the following menu:

_File | Import | Network | File..._ or using the shortcut keys _Ctrl/Cmd + L_ (_Figure 2(a)_)

![Import network (a) and nodes/edges attributes (b) in Cytoscape software](https://github.com/csclab/RMut/blob/master/vignettes/transition_menu.png)

In next steps, we import two CSV files of nodes/edges attributes via _File | Import | Table | File..._ menu (_Figure 2(b)_). For the nodes attributes file, we should select _String_ data type for the column _NetworkState_ (_Figure 3_). For the edges attributes file, we must select _Edge Table Columns_ in the drop-down list beside the text _Import Data as:_ (_Figure 4_).

![Nodes attributes importing dialog](https://github.com/csclab/RMut/blob/master/vignettes/transition_menu_attr_node.png)

![Edges attributes importing dialog](https://github.com/csclab/RMut/blob/master/vignettes/transition_menu_attr_edge.png)

After importing, we select _Style_ panel and modify the node and edge styles a little to highlight all attractor cycles. For node style, select _Red_ color in _Fill Color_ property for the nodes that belong to an attractor (_Figure 5(a)_). Regards to edge style, select _Red_ color in _Stroke Color_ property and change _Width_ property to a larger value (optional) for the edges that connect two states of an attractor (_Figure 5(b)_). 

![Nodes (a) and edges (b) style modification](https://github.com/csclab/RMut/blob/master/vignettes/style_node_edge.png)

As a result, _Figure 6_ shows the modified transition network with clearer indication of attractor cycles.

# Structural characteristics computation

## Feedback/Feed-forward loops search

Via _findFBLs_ and _findFFLs_, the package supports methods of searching feedback/feed-forward loops (FBLs/FFLs), respectively, for all nodes/edges in a network. The following is an example R code for the search:

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# search feedback/feed-forward loops
amrn <- findFBLs(amrn, maxLength = 10)
amrn <- findFFLs(amrn)
print(amrn$nodes)
print(amrn$edges)
print(amrn$network)
```

In the above output, some abbreviations in the two nodes/edges data frames are explained as follows (refer to the literature [3-4] in the References section for more details):

* _NuFBL_: number of feedback loops involving the node/edge

* _NuPosFBL_, _NuNegFBL_: number of positive and negative feedback loops, respectively, involving the node/edge

* _NuFFL_: number of feed-forward loops involving the node/edge

* _NuFFL\_A_, _NuFFL\_B_ and _NuFFL\_C_: number of feed-forward loops with role A, B and C, respectively, involving the node

* _NuFFL\_AB_, _NuFFL\_BC_ and _NuFFL\_AC_: number of feed-forward loops with role AB, BC and AC, respectively, involving the edge

In the _network_ data frame, _NuFBL_, _NuPosFBL_, _NuNegFBL_, _NuFFL_, _NuCoFFL_ and _NuInCoFFL_ denote total numbers of FBLs, positive/negative FBLs, FFLs and coherent/incoherent FFLs in the network, respectively.

## Centrality measures computation

The _calCentrality_ function calculates node-/edge-based centralities of a network such as Degree, In-/Out-Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Stress, Eigenvector, Edge Degree and Edge Betweenness. An example is demonstrated as follows:

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# calculate node-/edge-based centralities
amrn <- calCentrality(amrn)
print(amrn$nodes)
print(amrn$edges)
```

# Export results

Via _output_ function, all examined attributes of the networks and their nodes/edges will be exported to CSV files. The structure of these networks are also exported as Tab-separated values text files (.SIF extension). The following is an example R code for the output:

```{r}
library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# generate all possible initial-states each containing 10 Boolean nodes
set1 <- generateStates(10, "all")

# generate all possible groups each containing a single node in the AMRN network
amrn <- generateGroups(amrn, "all", 1, 0)
amrn <- calSensitivity(amrn, set1, 1, "knockout")

# search feedback/feed-forward loops
amrn <- findFBLs(amrn, maxLength = 10)
amrn <- findFFLs(amrn)

# calculate node-/edge-based centralities
amrn <- calCentrality(amrn)

# export all results to CSV files
output(amrn)
```

# Batch-mode analysis

The methods of dynamics and structure analysis described in the above sections (except the _findAttractors_ function due to memory limitation) could also be applied to a set of networks, not limited to a single network. The RMut package provides the _createRBNs_ function to generate a set of random networks using a generation model from among four models (refer to the literature in the References section for more details):

* Barabasi-Albert (BA) model [1]

* Erdos-Renyi (ER) variant model [2]

* Two shuffling models (Shuffle 1 and Shuffle 2) [3]

Here, we show two examples of generating a set of random networks and analyzing dynamics-related sensitivity and structural characteristic of those networks:

_Example 1_

```{r}
# Example 1: generate random networks based on BA model #
#########################################################

library(RMut)
# generate all possible initial-states each containing 10 Boolean nodes
set1 <- generateStates(10, "all")

# generate two random networks based on BA model
ba_rbns <- createRBNs("BA_RBN_", 2, "BA", 10, 17)

# for each random network, generate all possible groups each containing a single node
ba_rbns <- generateGroups(ba_rbns, "all", 1, 0)

# for each random network, calculate the sensitivity values of all nodes against "knockout" mutation
ba_rbns <- calSensitivity(ba_rbns, set1, 1, "knockout")

# for each random network, calculate structural measures of all nodes/edges
ba_rbns <- findFBLs(ba_rbns, maxLength = 10)
ba_rbns <- findFFLs(ba_rbns)
ba_rbns <- calCentrality(ba_rbns)

print(ba_rbns)
output(ba_rbns)
```

_Example 2_

```{r}
# Example 2: generate random networks based on "Shuffle 2" model #
##################################################################

library(RMut)
data(amrn)

# generate all possible initial-states each containing 10 Boolean nodes
set1 <- generateStates(10, "all")

# generate two random networks based on "Shuffle 2" model
amrn_rbns <- createRBNs("AMRN_RBN_", 2, "shuffle 2", referedNetwork = amrn)

# for each random network, generate all possible groups each containing a single edge
amrn_rbns <- generateGroups(amrn_rbns, "all", 0, 1)

# for each random network, calculate the sensitivity values of all edges against "remove" mutation
amrn_rbns <- calSensitivity(amrn_rbns, set1, 1, "edge removal")

# for each random network, calculate structural measures of all nodes/edges
amrn_rbns <- findFBLs(amrn_rbns, maxLength = 10)
amrn_rbns <- findFFLs(amrn_rbns)
amrn_rbns <- calCentrality(amrn_rbns)

print(amrn_rbns)
output(amrn_rbns)
```
